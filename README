Acme::Tie::Eleet - Perl extension to 5pE4k 1Ik3 4n 3l337!

DESCRIPTION

    Have you ever wanted to speak like an eleet? Do you feel like it's too
    difficult to do your case mixin' manually? Tired of being laugh at by
    your mates because your quotes don't make you look like an h4x0r? Well,
    there's a solution, and you're reading the documentation of the module
    specially made for u, Ye4h M4n!

    This module basically allows you to perform a tie on filehandles,
    converting text written to it - and even read from!

    And since it's quite difficult to do urself a tie, the module will also
    tie the 2 (no, not the letter 'S', the figure, u b4st4rd) standard file
    descriptors perl comes with (aka, STDOUT and STDERR). A simple use of
    the module and you're ready to go! Fe4R u5!


INSTALLATION

    To install this module type the following:
       perl Makefile.PL
       make
       make test
       make install

TODO

    - Find more h4x0R quotes to add.
    - Allow user to provide a dictionnary for words. Back­
      ward compatibility would be ok since a ref to a hash
      evaluates to true.
    - Allow user to provide a hash of quotes for both
      add_before / add_after. Backward compatibility would
      be ok since a ref to a hash evaluates to true.
    - Allow user to provide an array of quotes to add. Back­
      ward compatibility would be ok since a ref to a hash
      evaluates to true.
